Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n![](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mah537/ist412/images/team5soak1.png)\r\n\r\n### This baby runs sweet\r\nSmooth UX/UI design. like butter.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/45/94/22/45942214411ce66240006fd63bf7b224.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
